            "00 years ago. They were closely related to modern elephants and shared many physical characteristics, such as a trunk, tusks, and thick skin. However, mammoths were\n",
            " much larger than their modern counterparts, standing up to 13 feet tall at the shoulder and weighing up to 12 tons. They were also adapted to\n",

            "\n",
            "There were several different species of mammoths, including the woolly mammoth, the Columbian mammoth, and the Steppe mammoth.\n",

During the last glacial period, mammoths were able to expand their range into areas that were previously too cold for them, such as northern Europe and Siberia.\n",

            "Mammoths were herbivores and their diet consisted mainly of grasses, sedges, and other plants that grew in their cold, open habitats. They used their large tusks to dig up roots and strip bark from trees. Mammoths' molars were also well-adapted to grinding up tough plant material.\n",

            "* **Overhunting by humans:** Humans began to hunt mammoths around 40,000 years ago, and this may have contributed to their extinction.

            "* **Woolly mammoth:** The most famous and well-studied species, found in Europe, Asia, and North America.\n",

            "\n",
            "Sadly, mammoths eventually went extinct around 10,000 years ago, with the exact cause still debated by scientists. Climate change, habitat loss, and hunting by early humans are all believed to have played a role.\n",

            "Despite their disappearance, mammoths remain a subject of great fascination. Their remains continue to be unearthed, providing valuable insights into their biology and behavior. Additionally, the possibility of cloning mammoths using preserved DNA is currently being explored, potentially bringing these incredible creatures back to life.\n",
